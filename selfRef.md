# React
- Open source JS library for building user interfaces
- Not Framwork
- Rich ecosystem
- Created and maintained by Facebook
- Component Based Architecture
- Reusable code
- React is declarative 
---
### Folder Structure
- package.json - caontains dependencies and scripts
- package-lock.json - ensure consistent installation of dependencies
- File flow: index.html -> main.tsx -> app.tsx
---
### Component
- Part of UI
- Resuable
- Types : 
  - functional component
    - Simple JS functions 
    - return html elements
    - Accept input as properties and returns HTML
    - Absence of 'this' keyword
    - Mainly responsible for UI
    - Solution without using state
    - Has state hooks and provide life cycle hooks
  - class component
    - Class extending React.Component class
    - Render() returns the HTML
    - Accept input as properties, contain private states and returns HTML
    - More feature rich
    - Maintain their own private data known as state
    - Complex UI logic
    - Provide life cycle hooks
- Export and import of components
- Export:
  - Default export
    - Import with any name
    - export default Trial1;
    - import Trial1 from "./components/Trial1";
    - import MyCustomName from "./components/Trial1";
    - return < Trial1 />;
    - return < MyCustomName />;
  - Named export
    - Import with defined name in { }
    - export const Trial1 = () => < p>Hello< /p>;
    - import { Trial1 } from "./components/Trial1";
    - return < Trial1 />;

### JSX
- JavaScript XML (JSX)
- Extension to JS language syntax
- JSX qultimately transpiles to pure JS which is understood by browser 
---
### Props
- Optional input that the component can accept 
- Object that contains attributes and their values which have been passed from their parent component
- Props are immutable
- Props are passed to the component
- They are the function parameters
- In Functional components : props
- In Class components : this.props
- Destructuring props :
  - const {prop1, prop2} = this.props
- < MyTag attribute = "value" / >
- < MyTag > children props < / MyTag > 
---
### State
- Object that is privately maintained by the component
- Stae is managed within the component
- Variables are declared in the function body 
- In Functional components : useState Hook
- In Class components : this.state
- State is mutable
- Never directly change state value instead do it via setState() else the UI is not re-rendered
- setState(value updation, callback function)
- setState is an asynchronous method
--- 
### Event Handling
- Event handler must be a function and not a function call
- ex: 
  - onClick = {clickHandle}   - Function      - Triggered on click
  - onClick = {clickHandle()} - Function call - Triggered when loaded
